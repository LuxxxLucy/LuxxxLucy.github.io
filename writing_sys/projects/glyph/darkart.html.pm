Given a line segment and an object, 
How to place the object at the right position somewhere in the line segment? 

Kenya Hara is said to be able to doing that. (someone said)

Can we learn a machine to be able to do that?

1. the machine should be able to learn about aesthetics
2. all the info should be based on past experience.
3. when we do the actual mental computation, we do not necessarily retrieve the old experience, we just make a decision 
4. The decision we make is highly sensitive. One tiny difference can break the entire thing.
5. the energy model should have as less "undesirable spike" as possible.

◊section{overview}

The method: Gaussian Process-DNN conversion as a way to train highly sensitive Energy based models.
