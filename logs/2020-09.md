# September 2020


## Summary of the month


## Logs

* bought the first edition of Henry Dyer's **Dai Nippon: a study of natural evolution**, cost about 250 CAD and finally shipped to me today. First glimpse feels great.

### 2/9/20

* [1:00] lab meeting, a stand-up meeting where everyone introduce their recent events. This sucks, I did not achieve anything. It's just failure that is always around me, like an invisible ghost always sits aside me.

### 1/9/20

* [0:30] wandering with the resources provided with the concept bottleneck paper (Koh et al, 2020) and find necessary instructions to reproduce the results.
* [1:00] reading bayesian program induction, works from Josh Tenenbaum. Perhaps I will need re-reading as lots of topics and context are not well understood by me.
* [0:10] revising the Neural DNF draft, all minor issues such as some typos.
* [0:30] sorting tasks and planning. 
* [1:30] coding. mainly some tedious part for adopting a new dataset. This sucks, really. I wish someone can get a perfect modularized dataset package where we can easily load any public datasets. 

misc:

* watching the [トリック劇場版 ラストステージ (2014)](https://movie.douban.com/subject/24844958/)
* two CDs by MONO, bought on Amazon are arrived. 

Past days have been of quite horrible quality; no focus and mind-numbing.

The next days will be about running new experiments for the Neural DNF paper.
