#emph[TL;DR] We introduce two fundamental operations *split* and *merge* that a vector graphics editor should support for manipulating the control points (nodes) of Bézier curves.


= Introduction <introduction>

Users of vector graphics editors routinely need to *split* and *merge* curve segments.

#margin-note[
  Popular vector graphics applications like Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, and Figma all provide curve cutting and joining tools that rely on these operations.
  However, merging is typically not implemented in a lossless way but rather handled by general-purpose simplification algorithms. More on this in the future.
]

Given an already-created path (a consecutive sequence of Bézier segments), split enables a user to create a new control point on a curve, making it possible to further manipulate the curve. In Inkscape, this is done by selecting the `Node` tool and double-clicking on a curve.

#margin-note[
  Throughout this blog, we focus on cubic Bézier curves. Linear and quadratic Bézier curves are trivial and can be pre-processed into cubic ones, while higher-order curves are beyond our scope.
]

Merge is the reverse operation of split.
Sometimes a user creates a new point, forgets about it, and ultimately makes no changes to it. Or data imported from external sources may naturally contain duplicated unnecessary points.
Ideally, cleanup is needed—either deliberately triggered by the user or implicitly performed during export.
These unnecessary points should be removed, effectively merging two or more Bézier segments back into one.

Note that split operations are always lossless—the path before and after splitting remains identical.
However, merge operations are not always lossless.

In Inkscape, merge can be achieved either by explicitly deleting a point using the *Node tool* or by applying the *Simplify* tool.
In both cases, the merge operation is not guaranteed to be lossless. Point deletion and simplification are both destructive processes that do not aim to preserve the original curve shape. After all, users may simply want to delete a point or simplify the curve without any expectation of lossless behavior.
For point deletion, if the curve can be merged losslessly, such deletion will indeed maintain the shape. However, for simplification, even when lossless merge is possible, the general-purpose simplification algorithm will still fail to recognize such merge opportunities.

In this blog, we focus on the lossless case where merge operations can recover the original curve exactly within numerical precision.

= Basic Formulation

We introduce the basic formulation of Bézier curves before diving into split and merge operations.

Cubic Bézier curves are defined by control points $p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3$:
#nonumeq(
$
B(t) = (1-t)^3 p_0 + 3(1-t)^2 t p_1 + 3(1-t) t^2 p_2 + t^3 p_3
$
)

The two operations are defined as follows:

1. *Split*: Given curve $B(t)$ with control points $p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3$ and parameter $t_s in [0,1]$, produce curves with control points $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3$ and $b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3$ such that:
   - Left curve represents $B(t)$ for $t in [0, t_s]$ 
   - Right curve represents $B(t)$ for $t in [t_s, 1]$

2. *Merge*: Given adjacent curves with control points $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3$ and $b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3$, reconstruct original control points $p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3$.

= Split: De Casteljau Construction <split>

De Casteljau's algorithm provides an elegant geometric method for splitting Bézier curves. Rather than manipulating the algebraic form, it uses repeated linear interpolation to find the split point and new control points.

#margin-note[
  Paul de Casteljau developed this algorithm in 1959 while working at Citroën, though it wasn't published until 1975. It predates Bézier's work by several years.
]

For a cubic curve with control points $p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3$, splitting at parameter $t$ proceeds in three levels:

*Level 1*: Linear interpolation between adjacent control points
#nonumeq(
$
q_0 &= p_0 + t(p_1 - p_0) = (1-t)p_0 + t p_1 \
q_1 &= p_1 + t(p_2 - p_1) = (1-t)p_1 + t p_2 \
q_2 &= p_2 + t(p_3 - p_2) = (1-t)p_2 + t p_3
$
)

*Level 2*: Interpolate between the $q$ points
#nonumeq(
$
r_0 &= q_0 + t(q_1 - q_0) = (1-t)q_0 + t q_1 \
r_1 &= q_1 + t(q_2 - q_1) = (1-t)q_1 + t q_2
$
)

*Level 3*: Find the split point
#nonumeq(
$
s = r_0 + t(r_1 - r_0) = (1-t)r_0 + t r_1
$
)

The split produces two cubic curves:
- *Left curve*: $a_0 = p_0, a_1 = q_0, a_2 = r_0, a_3 = s$
- *Right curve*: $b_0 = s, b_1 = r_1, b_2 = q_2, b_3 = p_3$

The algorithm constructs intermediate points through successive linear interpolations. (Modified from SFU CMPT361 lecture slides, see #link("https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/361/inkpen/Notes/361_deCasteljau_john.pdf")[link])]
) <decasteljau-split>

This construction guarantees that both resulting curves are valid cubic Bézier curves that together represent the original curve exactly.

It is worth noting that in a real editor, splitting does not proceed by the user providing a value of $t$ through a numerical input field. Rather, the user typically indicates the split location with a mouse cursor position.

The figure above is captured from a toy editor I made. There is also a live GIF so that this becomes intuitive to understand, see #link("https://luxxxlucy.github.io/projects/2025_bezielogue_2_split_and_merge/asset/cursor_split.gif")[here].

= Merge: Reconstructing the Original <merge>

Merge reverses the split operation. While we could consider merging multiple curve segments, we'll focus on the two-curve case (left and right curves). The multiple segment case becomes a trivial repeated application of the two-curve merge.

Consider a left curve with control points $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3$ and a right curve with control points $b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3$. For a valid merge, we need to verify three conditions:

*Condition 1: C0 Continuity*: The curves must connect—the last point of the left curve must equal the first point of the right curve:
#margin-note[
  An implementation detail: we need to determine the correct order of the two curves. A simple approach is to test both directions—if C0 continuity fails in both cases, the curves cannot be merged.
]
#nonumeq(
$
a_3 = b_0
$
)

*Condition 2: Direction Check*: Once we confirm the curves are connected, we verify that vectors $a_3 - a_2$ and $b_1 - b_0$ point in the same direction:
#nonumeq(
$
"angle"(a_3 - a_2) = "angle"(b_1 - b_0)
$
)

If this fails, the curves cannot be merged losslessly.

From de Casteljau's construction, we know:
$
(a_3 - a_2) / t = (b_1 - b_0) / (1-t)
$ <geometric-relationship>

#margin-note[
  This relationship emerges from the de Casteljau construction. The vectors $a_3 - a_2$ and $b_1 - b_0$ are scaled versions of the same geometric direction.
]

where $t$ is the original split parameter. We can solve for $t$:
#nonumeq(
$
t = frac(||a_3 - a_2||, ||a_3 - a_2|| + ||b_1 - b_0||)
$
)

*Condition 3: Intermediate Point Consistency*: The intermediate construction point must match:
#nonumeq(
$
a_1 + frac(a_2 - a_1, t) = b_2 + frac(b_1 - b_2, 1-t)
$
)
Referring to @decasteljau-split, we can compute the intermediate point $Q_1$ in two ways: from the left curve ($a_1 + frac(a_2 - a_1, t)$) or from the right curve ($b_2 + frac(b_1 - b_2, 1-t)$). The condition is satisfied when these two calculations yield the same point (within numerical tolerance).

Once the three conditions are met, we can reconstruct the original control points:
#nonumeq(
$
p_0 &= a_0 \
p_1 &= a_0 + frac(a_1 - a_0, t) \
p_2 &= b_3 + frac(b_2 - b_3, 1-t) \
p_3 &= b_3
$
)

= Verification of Equivalence <verification>

Testing and verification of split and merge operations require a distance measure to compare curves before and after operations. If the distance falls below a threshold, we can declare the operations lossless.
#margin-note[
  Wang, Siqi, et al. "Bézier Spline Simplification Using Locally Integrated Error Metrics." SIGGRAPH Asia 2023 Conference Papers. 2023.
]
Suitable distance measures include Hausdorff distance, Fréchet distance, or locally integrated distance (Wang et al. 2023).

Alternatively, we can utilize an SMT solver operating on real number theory.
The verification process encodes the equivalence check in a straightforward manner.

*Equivalence Check*: Given two curves $A$ and $B$ (each potentially composed of multiple segments), they are equivalent if and only if:
1. For all $t_1 in [0, 1]$, there exists $t_2 in [0, 1]$ such that $A(t_1) = B(t_2)$
2. For all $t_1 in [0, 1]$, there exists $t_2 in [0, 1]$ such that $B(t_1) = A(t_2)$

In SMT-LIB format, suppose $A$ and $B$ each have two curve segments: $A = \{\{p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3\}, \{p_4, p_5, p_6, p_7\}\}$ and $B = \{\{q_0, q_1, q_2, q_3\}, \{q_4, q_5, q_6, q_7\}\}$. We can write:

While the SMT-LIB syntax is verbose, the underlying concept is straightforward and easily automated.
