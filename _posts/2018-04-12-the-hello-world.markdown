# the First Post

So this is first post for the my `official` homepage. Assumedly the **first** post should be some sort of mile-stone because I finally get it done to build my own personal website. But it soon occurs to me that there is not much I could write down here about me.

# Quick Intro

It is just the case that people could easily write tons of stuff about themselves -- which literally mean something like honors, hobbies -- yet does not indicate anything truthfully at all.

So this is some quick intro of me:

1. The name is LU Jialin, pronounced like "Ja-Lin", originally in Chinese as "陸家林": where "陸" is the name of my family literally means "the land", and "家林" means a wish to " build a house in a flourishing forest and settle there".
2. This man enjoys doing research and design work. Currently (On April, 2018) he is expecting a bachelor's degree of computer science from [the College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/english/) and a bachelor's degree in industrial design from the [International Design Institute,Zhejiang University](http://www.idi.zju.edu.cn).
3. At this moment he is planning to pursue a career in the academia. But who knows what the future could be?

## hello and thanks

The purpose of this post is simply to say HELLO to all human and non-human beings!

However, there remains so much that needs to be done for this homepage if the homepage was made to form a complete picture of me. But I am not dying, or planning to die for quite a long time, I will just leave most of the work unfinished for the future me (hello there! If you are the future me, do not blame me for the tedious work! I am just lazy in my early 20s, I am sure you are quite a diligent man!).

This website is based on the template [MDUI](https://github.com/KeJunMao/jekyll-theme-mdui) which follows the Google's [Material Design](https://material.io), thanks for [Kejun](https://kejun.me) for implementing such a wonderful and easy-to-use framework! Thank you very much for this pretty template (but I'm planning for some minor changes though).

## plans

Several plans for future updates and goals (for this year 2018):

1. get the hack of some current research done.
2. Keep reading and exercising
3. Get some blogs done (about research)
4. Get some blogs done (about my own reading about arts and literature)

## To conclude

And, in the end, Hello World!

I understand that this world may not be as good as I thought when I was younger, but still it is a world that worths fighting for.

Wish you the Best, world,

Jialin
