# April 2021

The general goal is this month is
* learn program synthesis.
* TerpreT project.
* start also on other program synthesis projects

## 27/04/21
* starting marking the CMPT 419 final exam.
* Some thought experiment and writing for terpret.

## 26/04/21
* supervised the CMPT final exam. Quite a new experience to see people taking exam remotely and watching them Zoom.
* find a bug in my terpret optimizer. Bad news ...

## 25/04/21
* New formulation of problem. Now it is very conceptuall simple and principled!

## 23-24/04/2021
* finish the CMPT assignment grading.

## 22/04/2021
* have a better undestanding of the difference of algorithm.

## 21/04/2021
* think about and try out the idea of vector image, rasterization. And use differentiable programming to solve it (generative modelling). It seems to be a great idea. And perhaps perfectly suited for showcasing and compete with dreamcoder.

## 20/04/2021
* somehow managed to solve the shift task.

## 20/04/2021
* somehow managed to solve the NAND and Swap task.

## 19/04/2021
* complete the final exam making.
* make new plan.

## 15/04/2021
* last two days, since the circuit is not running very smoothly, now is working on DNF. But it is still failure.
* also tried binary network (-1,+1).

## 13/04/2021
* spent almost all day coding. Have a decent understandnig of the original TerpreT code. Implement the boolean circuits, and the vector-version parity chain.

## 12/04/2021
* TA meeting
* make final exam for CMPT.
* run TerpreT for sketch/smt, etc. Starting wokring on Turing Machine benchmarks.
* Make some short term plans

## 11/04/2021
* re-configurate for TerpreT.

## 10/04/2021
* set up the MFA for SFU login.
* start several things in Julia, learning.

## 08/04/2021
* still on making final exam. I think it should be accomplished tomorrow.

## 07/04/2021
* spend some time on making final exam for the TA course.

## 31/03/2021
* lab meeting.
* TA office hour.
* meet with Andy.
* tried to work on the TerpreT benchmarks. But it is too difficult.
* start to learn program synthesis by Solar-Lezama's course.
