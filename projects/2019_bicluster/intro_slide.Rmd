## 

Given a pre-trained DNN, we can discover several modules of task-correlated neurons, meaning,
some hidden neurons in the same group are functionally related for predicting a set of similar data samples, i.e. samples with similar feature patterns. We do this by applying network attribution and biclustering methods.

![*after the biclustering of related neurons*, there appears to be a checkboard pattern](./assets/matrix.png)

## 

We find that, unsurprisingly, the neurons are highly sparsely related, i.e., only a small subset of neurons are important for predicting a small subset of data samples

while we do not use any label supervision, samples corresponding to the same group (bicluster) show surprisingly coherent feature patterns.

*Some neuron group are highly class-specific*, i.e., some neurons as a group are responsible to classifying a certain class

## 

We can also use our method to discover novel data patterns, for example, gene motifs.
