I failed miserably, mainly because I under-estimate the problem and had a premature belief of the hype of deep learning. I reviewed the failure in <a href="https://luxxxlucy.github.io/projects/2020_glyph/index.html">this post</a> <label for="507777903980120582" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="507777903980120582" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://luxxxlucy.github.io/projects/2020_glyph/index.html">A Review of Failure - Deep Generative Model for Chinese Fonts</a></span>.<br/> --&gt;<br/>After that when I became more experienced during my master, I gradually start to lean myself in hybrid neural symbolic approaches, and also started to learn program synthesis. After I graduated and started working in industry, I resumed working on this project at night.<label for="1071793877622276499" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1071793877622276499" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Honestly, also sometimes during daytime, sorry Huawei</span></p><p>The main insipration of the new approach are some excellent yet relatively old and under-appreciated papers, as well as some recent advances in machine learning including differentiable rendering and energy-based model; they all contribute to make the current proposal a feasible approach.</p><p>It is a long way, and so I divided into smaller posts.</p><h2>Content</h2><ol><li><p><a href="./projects/glyph/0.html"><strong>The problem: how we end up in reality</strong></a></p></li><p>"Why we need computational aid for font design."</p><li><p><a href="./projects/glyph/1.html"><strong>The difficulty for computation: the nuance of typographic design</strong></a></p></li><p>"here I also talked about why the problem is hard, and why existing approaches are not producing satisfactory result."</p><li><p><a href="./projects/glyph/2.html"><strong>Approach: Overview</strong></a></p></li><p>"here I provide the general description of the approach.
