Reproduce the original estimation of Imai et al, 2020.

The reported estimate is 

> 1,723 cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan City (95% CI: 427 â€“ 4,471)


```{r}
num_intl_case = 3
# Exported number of confirmed cases
num_intl_passenger = 3301
# Daily international passengers travelling out of Wuhan International airport
catchment_in_million = 19
catchment = catchment_in_million * 10^6
# (in million) Effective catchment population of Wuhan airport
detection_window = 10
# (in days) Detection window 


p_intl_daily = num_intl_passenger / catchment
# daily prob of international travel

p = p_intl_daily * detection_window
# the probability any one case will be detected overseas

num_case = num_intl_case / p 
#total number of cases
print("the computed estimate is")
print(num_case)
```
