# October 2020

The general goal is this month is
* prepare a lab presentation, the topics will be about infusing Gaussian process and deep learning for better control of deep nets. in particular should have application in active learning, transfer learning.
* Continue working on Neural DNF
* the writing of master thesis.
* paperwork of the master thesis



### 31/10/20
* writing Neural DNF
* Read for EEG and interpretability
* reply emails
* initialize the glyph phase 0: *this kanji does not exist*.

### 30/10/20
* meet with Shuman and Hossein

### 29/10/20
* review the short and long term plan.
* meet with Martin.
* scheduling thesis defense.

### 28/10/20
* Wasted all day. I confess.

### 23/10/20
* meet with Martin

### 22/10/20
* make the Neural DNF work on a specifically designed dataset MNIST sums to Odd

### 20/10/20
* coding.

### 19/10/20
* reviewed a paper

### 17/10/20

* set up the project with Ali.
* some misc issues regarding github repo and collaborations.
* reviewed a paper
* making plan.
* Neural DNF
* Reading the uncertainty and OOD.

### 16/10/20
* initialize the draft of project with Shuman and Hossein and set everything up.
* meet with Ali
* [:] Many things of reading.
* Rethink on the project Neural DNF.

### 15/10/20
* schedule a meeting with Shuman and Hossein. Now we are going to start a new project in transfer learning

### 14/10/20
* give the talk at the lab meeting on the topic of **Mirror Integration**. I think this will be a good general topic to collaborate with a lot of my lab members.
* a lot of issues is stacked unprocessed, now starts to deal with them one by one.

### 13/10/20
* Finish the slides

### 9/10/20 - 12/10/20
* Preparing the draft slide for the lab presentation.

### 8/10/20
* Draft the outline of the slides.
* Meet with Martin

### 7/10/20
* [3:00] Reading About the neural symbolic AI hybrid models.
* [1:00] start the drafting of master thesis.
* [0:45] Reading about the Gaussian process


### 6/10/20
* sleep all day.

### 5/10/20
* [:50] meet with Martin to talk about the plan for the following months  including the Master thesis and about medication of the current project and then I'm going to give a live presentation in the Lab meeting.
* [:30] start the initial draft for the lab presentation
* [1:00] Reading about the Bayesian deep neural network and especially about the functional regularization.
