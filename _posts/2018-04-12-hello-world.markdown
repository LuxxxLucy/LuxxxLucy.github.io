# the first post

So this is an official homepage of myself. Quick intro: my name is LU Jialin, I enjoying doing research and design work and nothing else matters.

## hello and thanks

Just come and say HELLO all human and non-human beings!

However, there remains so much that needs to be done for this homepage. But I am not dying for quite a long time anyway.

This website is based on [MDUI](https://github.com/KeJunMao/jekyll-theme-mdui), thanks for [Kejun](https://kejun.me)! Thank you very much for this pretty template (but I'm planning for some minor changes though).

## plans

Several plans for future updates (for this year 2018):

1. get the hack of some current research done.
2. Keep reading and exercising 3.

And, Hello world!
