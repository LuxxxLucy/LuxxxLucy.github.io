# September 2020



The Summary of the month:

* This month has two main goals. First, I want to make a submission to the ICLR conference, by revising a rejected draft (from the NeurIPS submission).

* T experiment, a new one in a quite difficult dataset, is not working very easily. Several things changes.

* bought the first edition of Henry Dyer's Dai Nippon: a study of national evolution, cost about 250 CAD and finally shipped to me today. First glimpse feels great.



### 2/10/20 - 24/9/20

-  spent all the time working on the Neural DNF project and submit to the ICLR conference
- Still many things left with this project and I'll continue for this in the next month

### 24/9/20

- Finding a new way of experiment setting. This time should be easier to produce results.
- Writing.
- - Now especially focusing on the new experiment section.
  - Go back to abstract.
  - The intro.
  - Clarify the loss function issues.



### 23/9/20

- Lab meeting. Joint lab meeting of Martin’s group and Max’s group.
- meet again with Martin. Have some problems regarding some very basic questions.



### 21/9/20

- meet with martin again. Now face a new problem of the choice of objective function.



### 17/9/20

- [0:30] meet with Martin.

### 16/9/20

* lab social. (social distancing ver.)

### 14/9/20

* meet with Martin. planned a deadline to make a final decision (on the particular experimental setup)

### 13/9/20

* working on an analysis, more seriously about the hyperparameters.

### 11/9/20

*  the attempt of using a new regularization function does not end up well. Now go back to the basics of our method and start from the beginning. It seems that I am always making the failures.

### 8/9/20

* summarized the failures with Martin. Made a new plan on how to solve the problem

### 4/9/20 to 7/9/20

*  coding. Not really coding, just tuning the hyperparameters.

### 3/9/20

* [2:30] coding
* [0:15] reading neuro-symbolic integration.
* [1:00] meet with martin. Basically, a messy meeting, that I was supposed to present the experimental results, but I failed.

misc: took a walk to nearby park (the kensington park), there are more people outside than I expected. Approached the starbucks but it was closed as I was too late. The starback used to close at 9:00 PM, but I guess the pandemic changed something, it closes earlier.

### 2/9/20

* [1:00] lab meeting, a stand-up meeting where everyone introduce their recent events. This sucks, I did not achieve anything. It's just failure that is always around me, like an invisible ghost always sits aside me.
* [3:30] coding. Mainly reproducing the concept bottleneck (Koh et al 2018).

### 1/9/20

* [0:30] wandering with the resources provided with the concept bottleneck paper (Koh et al, 2020) and find necessary instructions to reproduce the results.
* [1:00] reading bayesian program induction, works from Josh Tenenbaum. Perhaps I will need re-reading as lots of topics and context are not well understood by me.
* [0:10] revising the Neural DNF draft, all minor issues such as some typos.
* [0:30] sorting tasks and planning.
* [1:30] coding. mainly some tedious part for adopting a new dataset. This sucks, really. I wish someone can get a perfect modularized dataset package where we can easily load any public datasets.

misc:

* watching the [トリック劇場版 ラストステージ (2014)](https://movie.douban.com/subject/24844958/)
* two CDs by MONO, bought on Amazon are arrived.

Past days have been of quite horrible quality; no focus and mind-numbing.

The next days will be about running new experiments for the Neural DNF paper.
